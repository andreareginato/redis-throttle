# Redis Throttle Middleware

This is a fork of the [Rack Throttle](http://github.com/datagraph/rack-throttle) middleware
that provides logic for rate-limiting incoming HTTP requests to Rack applications using
Redis as storage system. You can use `Rack::RedisThrottle` with any Ruby web framework based
on Rack, including Ruby on Rails 3.0 and Sinatra. This gem was designed to experiment rate 
limit with Rails 3.x and [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper/).

## Features

* Works only with Redis.
* Automatically deploy by setting `ENV['REDIS_RATE_LIMIT_URL']`.
* When the Redis connection is not available redis throttle skips the rate limit check (it does not blow up).
* Automatically adds `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers.
* Set MockRedis while running your tests


## Requirements

Devices API is tested against MRI 1.9.3.


## Installation

Update your gem file and run `bundle`

```ruby
gem 'redis-throttle', git: 'git://github.com/andreareginato/redis-throttle.git'
```

## Rails Example

```ruby
# At the top of config/application.rb
require 'rack/redis_throttle'

# Inside the class of config/application.rb
class Application < Rails::Application
  # Limit the daily number of requests to 2500
  config.middleware.use Rack::RedisThrottle::Daily, max: 2500
end
```

## Sinatra example 
   
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby -rubygems
require 'sinatra'
require 'rack/throttle'
use Rack::Throttle::Daily, max: 2500
```
    
## Rack app example 
 
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env rackup
require 'rack/throttle'
use Rack::Throttle::Daily max: 2500

run lambda { |env| [200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, "Hello, world!\n"] }
```

## Customizations

You can fully customize the implementation details of any of these strategies
by simply subclassing one of the default implementations. 

In our example we want to reach those goals.

* We want to use Doorkeper as authorization system (OAuth2)
* The number of daily requests are based on the user id and not the IP
  address (default in `Rack::RedisThrottle`)
* The number of daily requests is dynamically set per user by the
  `user#rate_limit` field.

Now subclass `Rack::RedisThrottle::Daily`, create your own rules and use it in your Rails app

```ruby
# /lib/middlewares/daily_rate_limit
require 'rack/redis_throttle'

class DailyRateLimit < Rack::RedisThrottle::Daily

  def call(env)
    @user_rate_limit = user_rate_limit(env)
    super
  end

  def client_identifier(request)
    @user_rate_limit.respond_to?(:_id) ? @user_rate_limit._id : 'user-unknown'
  end

  def max_per_window(request)
    @user_rate_limit.respond_to?(:rate_limit) ? @user_rate_limit.rate_limit : 1000
  end

  # Rate limit only requests sending the access token
  def need_protection?(request)
    request.env.has_key?('HTTP_AUTHORIZATION')
  end

  private

  def user_rate_limit(env)
    request      = Rack::Request.new(env)
    token        = request.env['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'].split(' ')[-1]
    access_token = Doorkeeper::AccessToken.where(token: token).first
    access_token ? User.find(access_token.resource_owner_id) : nil
  end
end
```

Now you can use it in your Rails App.

```ruby
# config/application.rb
module App
  class Application < Rails::Application
  
    # Puts your rate limit middleware as high as you can in your middleware stack
    config.middleware.insert_after Rack::Lock, 'DailyRateLimit'
```

## Rate limit headers

`Rack::RedisThrottle` automatically sets two rate limits headers to let the 
client know the max number of requests and the one availables.

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
    X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4999

When you exceed the API calls limit your request is forbidden.

    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
    X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0


# Testing your apps

While testing your Rack app Mock the redis connection by requiring this file

```ruby
  # Rate limit fake redis connection
  require 'rack/redis_throttle/testing/connection'
```



## HTTP client identification

The rate-limiting counters stored and maintained by `Rack::RedisThrottle` are
keyed to unique HTTP clients. By default, HTTP clients are uniquely identified
by their IP address as returned by `Rack::Request#ip`. If you wish to instead
use a more granular, application-specific identifier such as a session key or
a user account name, you need only subclass a throttling strategy implementation
and override the `#client_identifier` method.


## HTTP Response Codes and Headers

When a client exceeds their rate limit, `Rack::RedisThrottle` by default returns
a "403 Forbidden" response with an associated "Rate Limit Exceeded" message
in the response body. If you need personalize it, for example with a
JSON message.

```ruby
def http_error(request, code, message = nil, headers = {})
  [ code, { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json' }.merge(headers), [body(request).to_json] ]
end

def body(request)
  {
    status: 403,
    method: request.env['REQUEST_METHOD'],
    request: "#{request.env['rack.url_scheme']}://#{request.env['HTTP_HOST']}#{request.env['PATH_INFO']}",
    description: 'Rate limit exceeded',
    daily_rate_limit: max_per_window(request)
  }
end
```


## Notes

### Testing coverage

Only `Rack::RedisThrottle::Daily` has a test suite. We will cover all
the gem whenever I'll find more time and I'll see it being used widely.
